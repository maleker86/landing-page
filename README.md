Admittedly I coded the first fifth (1/5th) of this project in Notepad (while greatly suffering) and the final fourth (4/5ths) using... Let's say an alternative IDE. I managed to get home and push a near-fully complete project to Github. 

The IDE I was using had somewhat-live feedback & previws. 

Still, I do not recommend this method of work!!
